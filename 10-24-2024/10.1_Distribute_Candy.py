â®žAssignment Problem: There are N children standing in a line with some rating value. You want
to distribute a minimum number of candies to these children such that:
Each child must have at least one candy.
The children with higher ratings will have more candies than their neighbors.
You need to write a program to calculate the minimum candies you must give.
